# Fake Harmless Viruses Batch

Welcome to the Fake-Viruses Batch Repository! Here you will find a collection of harmless batch scripts that simulate the appearance of computer viruses. Please note that these scripts are purely for educational and entertainment purposes and do not contain any actual malicious code. They are designed to mimic the behavior of viruses in a safe and controlled environment.

## Disclaimer

I, [Your Name], want to clarify that I had nothing to do with the creation or distribution of actual malicious software. The scripts in this repository are entirely harmless and are meant to showcase basic batch programming techniques rather than causing any harm to your computer or data.
